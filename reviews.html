                Codepen: Codepen is "the best place to build and deploy a website, show off your work, build test cases, and find inspiration" as put in their words. 
                It is a community that allows you to test and show off HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is a very useful coummnity to use if you need to find bugs or get 
                some help with a project. The large community allows you to get help quickly, and should allow a good level of quality of code. It utilises a system called pens, 
                which is essentially an enviroment which contains all of the projects files and allows you to use them. Finally, if you're struggling to find inspiration on how
                to do something, it can be a very useful utility as the large and helpful community can give you several interpretations of one issue and allow you to see things 
                in a light you might not have managed otherwise.

                MDN Web Docs: Created by Mozilla, MDN is a website that documents website standards (and the mozilla projects like firefox) for developers to use. 
                This documentation can be very useful for learning how to implement certain feature into a web page and in making them compliant, and it includes
                documentation on everything from HTML5 to JavaScript, as well as CSS and also even HTML5 for mobile. MDN also has a discussion form, hosted by the company, 
                and finally it is kept well up to date so it can be used as a reliable resource. Overall, MDN exists more as a place to learn standards with a community to
                talk to being just a side part, whereas codepen is somewhere to directly get feedback and input from a large community and serves as a place to share code,
                though both certaintly serve as good, useful tools to a web developer.
