            On this page, you can find some information about a few basic terms used during web development.

             <p>
             HTML: HTML is the HyperText Markup Language. It desribes the structure of the page to computer, and it is comprised of elements. 
             These elements use tags (such as heading, paragraph, title etc) and the browser then interprets these to display the page correctly to the end user.
             </p>
             <p> JavaScript: Javascript is a object orientated programming language that is easily learned. It allows webpages to be more interactive and allows you
                 to create parts on a webpage that respond to user input, and it can be found on many websites (though not this one).
            </p>
             
            <p>CSS: CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets, is something that can be used to tell a browser how to display html elements. Whilst not critical 
                to a site, it is very important in modern sites as it's responsible for making them look nice and easily readable. Inside the style sheet will be
                all the information necessary for your browser to display the web page in a nice, user friendly fashion.
            </p> 
             <p>DIV Tags: DIV tags are use to create a section of a HTML file. It is used to contain parts of the page and allows specific parts of it to be modified etc. </p>
             <p>Embedding: Embedding is placing something within your webpage. This could be something like an image, sound or video, and allows something to be directly
                 used from the webpage then and there rather than needing you to view it in a different program for example.
             </p>
