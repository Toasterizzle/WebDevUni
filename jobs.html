         On this page, I will compare two different web development jobs, and note anything of interest that I found.
    </p>

                <h class="jobtitle"><a href="https://www.totaljobs.com/job/web-application-developer/spring-technology-job84923373">Job 1: Spring Technology - Web Application Developer</a></h>
                <p class="job1">
                        A web application developer develops web based applications, as the name would imply. They're responsible for making the applications built into websites, 
                        and normally work in large teams. In this specific job, they're looking for someone who can use ASP.net, NET Core, MVC, JavaScript, HTML and Css., and Work on projects alone or in groups,
                        and are able to analyse, design and develop web applications to the best of their ability with the use and knowledge of multiple different technologies.
                        This can be things like implementing easy to use software in order for the user/customer are able to create additions which allows for them to reach further business needs.
                        also allowing for planning of detailed evenets and projects, planning out costs and timings of each possibile and potential project.

                <h class="jobtitle"><a href="https://www.totaljobs.com/job/front-end-web-developer/benson-price-consultants-ltd-job84788297">Job 2: Benson Price Consultants - Front End Web Developer</a></h>
                <p class="job1">
                A front end web developer is responsible for creating the interface that the end user will be interacting with. This means turning all the code into easy to use
                graphical interfaces essentially, and I have found an example of a job listing for one too. From their listing, they're looking for someone who can use HTML, CSS
                & JavaScript WordPress to create creative designs and development of a large variety for multiple digital projects, who is 
                able to demonstrate the ability to develop eye-catching websites showing previous experience with advised languages
                as well as show a passion for UI and UX design.
            
                </p>
                <aside class="aside">
                        <h class="jobtitle">Final Comparison</h>
                        <p class="job1">
                        The First Job uses more practical skills to help with creating larger projects. Rather than focusing on the interface and beauty/ease which comes with UI,
                        it focuses more on trying to get features working and implementing  things to allow for ease of use,
                        allowing features which can reach multiple business needs whilst focusing on ensuring its ease for the user.
                        Rather than considering working alone, the job also considers working with people, planning projects and management of them in groups also. 
                        The second job however considers more creative take to web development/design,  working on larger projects.
                        Though not clear, it is very likely with the skills requested that they are after people with the strengths of working alone.
                        Showing previous experience (suggesting primarily from UI and UX areas more than scripting) to show their ability and experience in the area of web development/design.
