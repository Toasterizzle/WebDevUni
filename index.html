This website exists to show how websites are created with HTML and CSS. It also uses Flex to scale to screens easily.
It will also compare some other sites, and include a written review on this. It shall also compare two web development jobs,
and I shall also make a glossary page with web development terms. Finally, I shall include some YouTube videos for web development tutorials.

                    Hello there, I'm Aaron Charlesworth and I'm 19. I am currently doing Computer Systems Engineering at the Univeristy of Northampton and my main interest is 
                    computers and computer hardawre. I am hoping to either become a computer systems engineer or a network engineer by the end of the course. If you look 
                    to the left, you can unfortunately see what I look like.
